- 👋 Hi, I’m Arvind. I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science and because I have always been interested in language (and languages), went on to do a Master's in Linguistics. I've spent nearly 15 years in the language industry, ending up as a Language Services Project Manager in Bangalore. I quit my job in March 2021 to take a break, without any plan in particular.
- 👀 I recently became interested in going back to programming. A lot of new and exciting stuff seems to be happenning from when I was doing it in college 20 years ago. AI and Machine Learning, which were not such a big deal then, have really come into their own. So I find myself drawn to coding once again.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning.... - I have no idea what I am doing, just trying to find my way back using online resources.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Not ready to collaborate on anything right now! :)
